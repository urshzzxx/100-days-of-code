## Day 1: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Color Game Project on Web Developer Bootcamp. This project touches base on:

- Arrays
- For Loops
- HTML tags (``class
   id
   div
   span``)
- ```querySelector```
- CSS styling (``margin
  padding
  float``)
- Toggling Events
- if/else statements
- functions
- ```addEventListener```

**Thoughts:** This is the first big project we have that uses most of the methods we've been learning so far in this bootcamp journey. It makes me nervous because if this wasn't a code-along, I wouldn't know where to start. But watching the lessons shows you how each method is applied in a project. I'm going to do the code-along the first time and then attempt to do it on my own the second time but add my own twist to it so that I'm challenging myself.
