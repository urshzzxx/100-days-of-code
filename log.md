# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished the HTML5 and CSS section of fCC. It was a refresher because I'm trying to catch up fCC with my Web Developer Bootcamp so that I can do JavaScript on both and gain two perspectives.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I'm already quite comfortable with HTML/CSS and googling things if I don't know something but it's always good to review everything. I'm not a big fan of freeCodeCamp's environment to code, but I thought the tutorials were helpful. They had a great explanation on hex colors, padding, and margins.
