## Day 1: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Color Game Project on Web Developer Bootcamp. This project touches base on:

- Arrays
- For Loops
- HTML tags (``class
   id
   div
   span``)
- ```querySelector```
- CSS styling (``margin
  padding
  float``)
- Toggling Events
- if/else statements
- functions
- ```addEventListener```

**Thoughts:** This is the first big project I have that uses most of the methods we've been learning so far in this bootcamp journey. It makes me nervous because if this wasn't a code-along, I wouldn't know where to start. And I know it would take me atleast a month to build this, if not, maybe two months. Programmers are so damn smart! But also, the code-along helps me understand the thought-process of a software engineer and I'm more familiar with how everything came together and used in a real app. Something as simple as a comma can break a website! That's absolutely crazy. ::skull::

## Day 2: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on the Color Game. I added my own CSS instead of following exactly what the game looked like. I think it looks so cute.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good! This is SO dope. The fact that I learned how to generate random colors from code is so cool. It's interesting to see how JavaScript brought a game to life. And even though this isn't something that I came up with on my own, it's so cool to be able to see it function and have fun with it. I'm more aware of the concepts and methods and how to use them as a form of problem solving so I think that's a plus. I can't wait to learn more and build more. DOM Manipulation is so, so interesting.
