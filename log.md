# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: May 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** The goal was to learn git and GitHub. I watched a bunch of tutorials on YouTube from DevTips and other channels. I also skipped to the lessons about git and github in my online bootcamp lessons and learned that git and github are two seperate things. I don't know how to use command line yet because I'm a newbie but I think once I have a grasp on that, using terminal would be easier. I learned how to clone a repo though!

**Thoughts:** I got extremely stressed out and frustrated because I spent so much time watching tutorials on git and github and still felt like I didn't know how to use it. I wanted to log my progress and keep myself accountable for this challenge. I don't know how to commit and push changes onto github. But, I think once I play around with it a bit more I'll get it. 

## Day 2: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to commit and push changes onto GitHub by having someone walk me through the terminal. I also re-watched DevTips video on the command line and I think I have a brief grasp on it. My main goal was to continue working on the startup landing page for my Web Dev Bootcamp using Bootstrap. I created a pretend landing page for Daenerys Targaryen. I added a Nav Bar, Header, a divider, an image, and some text onto the page.

**Thoughts:** I'm fairly new to Bootstrap so I get a little frustrated using it because the terms are meaningless. But I enjoyed overriding some of the CSS from Bootstrap to create my own. I can see how useful Bootstrap is and I'm learning how to google, copy, and paste, as much as possible and then modifying it to be my own version.

## Day 3: May 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I got furthur with my Daenerys Targaryen landing page using Bootstrap. I added my own twist and went in my own direction from the Web Development Bootcamp code along and changed the color of the header and the text. 

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to learn more about what CSS can do. Someone on Twitter recommended that I do a CSS animation to create a dragon for the landing page, which I thought was a dope idea so I want to learn some CSS animation very soon but I'm thinking about completing this project first, moving along to JavaScript and then coming back to it when I have more knowledge in code.

## Day 4: May 26, 2017

**Today's progress:** Almost done with the utilization of Bootstrap and the startup landing page. I learned how to use text-shadow in CSS! I still need to learn how to change the hover color for my Nav Bar and Buttons in CSS. I also learned how to add cool icons fron Font Awesome.

**Thoughts:** I recently started learning CSS and Bootstrap and I feel more comfortable using it than before. Bootstrap was one of those things when first introduced, I was like "hmm...this is intimidating" but because I pushed myself to use it, I feel good learning more about it and notice how useful it is industry-wide and can save so much time.

## Day 5: May 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Bootstrap landing page for my Web Dev Bootcamp. I looking into CSS Animations but I think that I'm going to come back to it and fully immerse myself in it after my JavaScript lessons. I also wanted to contribute to the CSS Zen Garden project but I looked at some of the projects and their code and it seemed like they used JavaScript so I'm also going to come back to that.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I get overwhelmed and anxious because there's SO much to learn and so much that you can do with code and technology and a lot of it is out of my capabilities right now. I'm about to start my classes on JavaScript so that I can understand the fundamentals of what I can do within Front-End Development as well as Back-end. So I'm going to put animations and my CSS Zen Garden project on hold for a bit.

## Day 6: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I had a lecture on the 5 primitive datatypes of JavaScript: numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined. 

**Thoughts:** I already knew the difference between the 5 datatypes but it felt good to refresh my memory. I'm definitely not comfortable with JavaScript yet but the way that the instructor explained the differences helped me understand these concepts.

## Day 7: June 6, 2017

I took a mini vacation from my job and coding for a few days to get myself together. I feel like I'm ready to take on the coding world again after a short break from life.

**Today's Progress:** I learned about built-in JavaScript methods such as alert(), console.log, and prompt(). With this knowledge, I was able to create an age calculator using all three methods. Fun Fact: I've discovered that at 24 years old, the age calculator declares that I've been alive for roughly 8742 days!

**Thoughts:** Reviewing the built-in methods felt good. What I liked about the lecture was that it was nice to have a visual of how each method works vs. reading about them, which I've done in the past. I felt like I had a better understanding of what these methods are used for when the instructor explained them.

## Day 8: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I had a lecture on Boolean logic, logic operators, and then did some exercising using conditionals. I also learned how to use the while loop!

**Thoughts:** Learning these JavaScript basics again feels really good because I feel like I have a better understanding of how each method works. Infinite loops are scary! I broke my chrome browser by trying out one of the infinite loop examples so I had to restart my entire laptop. What if you create an infinite loop in a production program? That could be so bad! I like using if/else statements because it's as if I'm speaking in english, but really writing the logic in code. It's interesting, I'm excited for more exercises and practice on this.
