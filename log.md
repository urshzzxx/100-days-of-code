# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goal:
1. Finish Web Developer Bootcamp
2. Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep
  - Ruby Fundamentals
  - JavaScript
3. Read JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett


## Day 1: July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked through ten JavaScript Basics Control Flow exercises on Web Developer Bootcamp. I relearned what while loops are and worked through some exercises. I also learned that I can very quickly break my computer with an infinite loop! :skull:

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling good! I struggled a few times with modulo % because I generally suck at math but I thought it was cool that you can write loops in different ways and have them output odd/even numbers. The indexOf() method was cool too. I like that Colt Steele brings up methods that we have to google during the exercises. It makes the work challenging, as if you're in an actual production environment. So I feel good! Makes my googling skills stronger!

## Day 2: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed the Intro to For Loops exercises on Web Developer Bootcamp. It was similar to the while loops exercises. I also finished JavaScript Functions tutorials and exercises, which covered functions syntax, arguments, and return.

**Thoughts:** Colt Steele's exercises are great. He teaches you how to google information if you don't know something so I've been trying master this skill; it'll be useful in the long run. I was frustrated with figuring out how to get a function to return a factorial of a number so I worked on it for a little bit, did some googling, and plugged in a few things and realized it worked! I needed the problem solution explanation though to understand why this is how the function returned a factorial.

```
function factorial(num) {
  // define a result variable
  var result = 1;
  for(var i = 2; i <= num; i++){
    result *= i;
  }
  //return the result variable
  return result;
}
```

## Day 3: July 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked through scopes and higher order functions on Web Developer Bootcamp. I learned about passing function into other functions. I also applied to be an editor for Medium so I worked through the edit challenge from Quincy Larson.

**Thoughts:** I think higher order functions are a bit confusing. I played around with it for a little bit to create my own and it's cool but I want to see how they work in an actual running app/production website.

## Day 4: July 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked through Introduction to Arrays on Web Developer Bootcamp. Went over some built-in methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), indexOf, and slice().

**Thoughts:** This lesson was a nice refresher because I remembered these methods from doing Flatiron's Bootcamp Prep program. I was able to create my own exercises and use these methods in them so today was a good day!

## Day 5: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I applied to Medium to be a volunteer editor so even though I wasn't actively coding, I took the time to read over the guidelines for the position and read an article on Arduino - which I thought was super interesting.

**Thoughts:** I struggled editing the article because I haven't edited something in so long. However, it was interesting reading a tech article and learning some of the terminology. I'm going to give it another shot tomorrow and submit it to Quincy.

## Day 6: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on Arrays To Do List part one on Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Part one of the arrays To Do List code along - I felt like I didn't grasp much from the lesson because I was confused. It's nice to see his thought process in these code alongs but I wish he'd let us do some of the challenges on our own so it forces us to learn.

## Day 7: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on Array Iteration today. I learned how to iterate through arrays using for loops and forEach.

**Thoughts:** I struggled understanding how to use forEach(). I know that it iterates through an array but I'm still struggling with the passing functions within functions. I feel like the code gets messy and then my thought process gets messy - but then again, I didn't understand for loops in the beginning either so...practice makes perfect!

## Day 8: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Part Two of the To Do List Code Along. My goal was to finish the entire Array section by now but that didn't go as planned because I did some external research on what each method does and took extra time to try to understand it.

**Thoughts:** So my JavaScript prompt kept loading before my HTML loaded even though my ```<script>``` tag was at the bottom of the ```<body>``` tag. I couldn't open my console to view my list because the ```prompt``` wouldn't stop showing up. This was definitely one of my least favorite exercises in the class. However - I learned about

```
window.onload = function() {
}
```

I wanted to understand what would make my HTML page load before my JavaScript. Even though it didn't really work, I now know there is another solution!

## Day 9: July 20, 2017
