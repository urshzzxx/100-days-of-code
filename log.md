# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goal:
1. Finish Web Developer Bootcamp
2. Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep
    - Ruby Fundamentals
    - JavaScript
3. Read JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett
4. Get into a In-Person Immersive Program in one of the three bootcamps.


## Day 1: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Color Game Project on Web Developer Bootcamp. This project touches base on:

- Arrays
- For Loops
- HTML tags (``class
   id
   div
   span``)
- ```querySelector```
- CSS styling (``margin
  padding
  float``)
- Toggling Events
- if/else statements
- functions
- ```addEventListener```

**Thoughts:** This is the first big project I have that uses most of the methods we've been learning so far in this bootcamp journey. It makes me nervous because if this wasn't a code-along, I wouldn't know where to start. And I know it would take me atleast a month to build this, if not, maybe two months. Programmers are so damn smart! But also, the code-along helps me understand the thought-process of a software engineer and I'm more familiar with how everything came together and used in a real app. Something as simple as a comma can break a website! That's absolutely crazy. ::skull::

## Day 2: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on the Color Game. I added my own CSS instead of following exactly what the game looked like. I think it looks so cute.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good! This is SO dope. The fact that I learned how to generate random colors from code is so cool. It's interesting to see how JavaScript brought a game to life. And even though this isn't something that I came up with on my own, it's so cool to be able to see it function and have fun with it. I'm more aware of the concepts and methods and how to use them as a form of problem solving so I think that's a plus. I can't wait to learn more and build more. DOM Manipulation is so, so interesting.

## Day 3: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Color Game Project, learned about refactoring the code, and started Intro to jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I thought the RBG Color Game project was so fckin' cool and I felt like I was finally taught to make something worthy of sharing! I'm still extremely fascinated about seeing the code come to life. I was getting a little bored with the lessons because I learn by ~ doing ~ so I thought this was a really great project. I'm going to re-do it after I finish my jQuery lessons so that I have a better understanding of refactoring, how methods are used, and possibly try to add my own JavaScript twist to it.

Here's the finished project as of right now:

## Day 4: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coded for an hour. Sat through the entire Intro to jQuery on Web Developer Bootcamp and took some notes.

**Thoughts:** It's interesting to learn the difference between vanilla Javascript and jQuery. I thought DOM Manipulation was hard when I first learned it but now that I have a better understanding of it, jQuery seems pretty cool. I have trouble with for loops so this makes life so much easier.

## Day 5: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Sat through the Advanced jQuery lessons for about an hour while also doing my own research on the methods ```click()```, ```keypress()```, ```keyup()```, ```keydown()``` ```on()```. Also looked into http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/.

**Thoughts:** Feeling ok! It's a little boring because I'm not building anything but it's interesting to know these things/how to use the jQuery library. To me, jQuery still looks like the shorter method because for loops trip me up. Like I think ```$(el).fadeIn();``` is pretty cool vs. writing it in vanilla JS, which is A LOT of code. Can't wait to actually build something with this though.

## Day 6: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started the To-Do List project on Web Dev Bootcamp. I learned about folder structure and how to add libraries to my code. I also went over some basic HTML and sketched out what I wanted to create for this since I'm going to make it my own.

**Thoughts:** I think this project is going to be fun. Instead of creating a To-Do list though, I'm going to create a beauty routine list because I identify with that a lot more. I was confused with the folder structure though because on my laptop, the folders show a file named ```.DS_Store``` and I have no idea what that means and then adding the links from folder trees was confusing too. But definitely something to get used to!

## Day 7: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coded for an hour and continued with the To-Do List project, except it's called the Beauty Routine project now because I made it my own, haha.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm building something worthwhile and I'm excited. ```toggleClass``` makes the code so much shorter in jQuery!!! SO COOL.

## Day 8: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coded for an hour. Continued to work on my Beauty Routine project.

**Thoughts:** Instead of using ```append()``` in jQuery, I wanted to add something new at the top of my Beauty Routine List instead of the bottom so I learned about ```prepend()``` and used that instead. So I'm feeling ok! I'm excited to learn more about functionality.

## Day 9: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on and finished the Beauty Routine list. Added my own CSS styling to it. The project adds and removes a beauty routine product that the user can enter into the app. I also added a little moon icon using font-awesome so I thought that was cute!

**Thoughts:** I went back to using ```append()``` instead of ```prepend()``` because it made more sense to add new values to the bottom (in this case at least bc it's in order). It's really cool to see the functionality of something like this because we enter and remove information all the time. I thought it was also cool when the value typed into the ```input``` was extracted and entered into a list-form. I think jQuery is awesome and seems simple to use instead of the complex logic. It was fun building something that I can actually use. I definitely want to come back to this and add more styling because I think it looks a bit plain right now, maybe add animation when I learn it.

## Day 10: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started the Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep course. My goal is to finish this course so that I can get into the In-person immersive program! I completed the HTML and CSS Fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good! I feel like I have a good grasp on HTML/CSS. I thought the CSS Diner game was really fun and helpful and a nice refresher on the basics. It's also quite addicting so I played that for a bit. There are definitely some CSS selectors that I could use help with so this game made me realize where I need and it's definitely worth playing a few times. I learned about
- Combine Class selectors ```A:className```
- ```:first-child```
- ```:only-child```
- ```:last-child```
- Sibling selectors ```A ~ B```
- ```:nth-child```

AND THEN
- ```[attribute^="value"]```
- ```[attribute$="value"]```
- ```[attribute*="value"]```

These stood out to me because I was actually asked in a technical interview way back when I was new at coding to changing my code to select everything that starts with the letter 'B' and I didn't know how, haha, but PLAY THE GAME!

## Day 11: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Read two articles on CSS Selectors: "The 30 CSS Selectors You Must Memorize" and "Meet Pseduo Class Selectors" and then proceeded with JavaScript Basics on Bootcamp Prep.

**Thoughts:** Is it actually possible to memorize all of these selectors? I wrote down notes and am making myself aware of them but...memorizing something I can google if needed to use seems like a better option. I definitely think I'll look over that article once more though.

## Day 12: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Refreshed my memory on JavaScript Basics, learned about the History of JavaScript, reviewed The Dom and different selectors using The DOM.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good! I'm getting comfortable with ```document.querySelector``` and their attributes. I learned about retrieving links by added ```.text``` and ```.href``` to the end of ```document.querySelector('a')```.

## Day 13: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:*** Reviewed Strings & Numbers on Bootcamp Prep and learned about ```innerHTML``` and ```parseInt()```.

**Thoughts:** I forgot about getting a second ```class``` or ```id``` and then I remembered ```querySelectorAll()[1]``` gets the second class name. And then in order to convert a string into a number you have to use ```parseInt()``` so it doesn't just append to a string.

## Day 14: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:*** I learned what Node.js finally is! In the Bootcamp Prep course, I downloaded the Learn program to set up the coding environment and then reviewed conditionals again with some exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking that I should create my own conditional statements just to practice more but other than that, feeling good.

## Day 15: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:*** Went over Node Practice in Bootcamp Prep and did research on what ```require()``` means in the code. Did some test labs since this course is very test based and I used the terminal to ```npm install mocha```.

**Thoughts:** I like the Learn app because it's similar to atom.io and I feel like I'm actually writing code. I also like the test runs because it feels like a challenge.

## Day 16: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the Bootcamp Prep Functions and Scope lessons and labs.

**Thoughts:** This section wasn't that hard for me because I'm pretty comfortable with what variables and functions are. Scopes are a little confusing - I know the difference between global scope and local scope but accessing a "secret scope" within a function was confusing for me.

## Day 17: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I reviewed arrays and how to manipulate them and then used the methods to complete the arrays lab.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling ok! When I worked on the lab, I was confused about destructively adding/removing elements on an array and non-destructive methods. I was more confused about the ```spread operator``` so I had trouble with the exercises because in the past, I've only been taught the ```push()``` and ```unshift()``` method. When does one use the ```spread operator``` really? I have to do more research. But I understand that if I'm adding an element to the end of an array, I would write ```["element", ...array]``` and if I'm adding something to the beginning, I would write ```[...array, "element"]```.

## Day 18: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Objects and worked on the Objects Lab on Bootcamp Prep.

**Thoughts:** I learned about the literal syntax and the object constructor. I know how to use the literal syntax to create an object but I'm still a bit shaky with the object constructor as well as ```object.Assign()```. I definitely need to do more reading on non-destructive methods because I don't understand when to use them.

## Day 19: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the loops lab on Bootcamp Prep. Man oh man, I definitely needed to review loops. I learned about the ```for loop```, ```while loop``` and ```do-while loop```.

**Thoughts:** So pretty much the ```for loop``` is used when you know how many times you're going to want the loop to run. The prompt was:

Build a function ```forLoop```. It takes an array as an argument. Start counting from 0, and, using a ```for``` loop, add a string to the array 25 times. But not just any string. If your ```i``` value is ```1```, add the string ```"I am 1 strange loop."```; if your ```i``` value is anything else, add the string ```"I am ${i} strange loops."```. Then return the array. So the code I wrote was this:

``` function forLoop(array) {
  for(var i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
    if(i === 1) {
      array.push("I am 1 strange loop.");
    } else {
      array.push(`I am ${i} strange loops.`);
    }
  }

  return array
};
```

If my ```i``` value is equal to ```1``` then I added the string ```I am 1 strange loop``` onto the array with the ```push()``` method. If it was anything else, I added ```I am ${i} strange loops.``` which executed the loop 25 times. I tested it out in console and got a few errors because I was using ```var array = [];``` in the beginning to add onto an empty string and then quickly realized that it wouldn't work so I commented it out and the test passed without it!

## Day 20: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on the loops lab. This time I practiced using the ```while-loop``` and ```do-while loop.```

**Thoughts:** I DO NOT like the ```do-while loop```. I feel like the ```for loop``` and ```while loop``` are pretty straightforward with what it's look for. The ```do-while loop``` is so confusing! I definitely got stuck and I don't fully understand why we have to specify that the loop is going to be 50% true or not. I understand that the body of the ```do-while``` loop runs at least once but I'm not sure how/when to use this loop. So this lab was definitely harder.

## Day 21: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Beatles Loop Lab on Bootcamp Prep. I struggled with this one because it's my first real solo lab that has nothing to do with practice material.

**Thoughts:** It was frustrating because I'm not comfortable with while-loops. I did pretty well with the first prompt by playing around with the code and re-reading the directions. The second prompt I had trouble with. The scenario was:

Create a function johnLennonFacts. This function will accept one argument, an array of facts about John Lennon. Use a while loop to loop over the facts array and add ```"!!!"``` to the end of every fact. The function should return an array of strings with exclamation points.

I knew that the first thing I needed to do was to create the function that took in facts as the argument

``` function johnLennonFacts(facts) {

}
```

And then return an array of strings so this could be named anything. THEN, in the code, I would have to create an empty array because I have to add ```"!!!"``` to it along with the ```facts```. So my code looked like this:

``` function johnLennonFacts(facts) {
  var shoutedFacts = [];
  //while loop
  return shoutedFacts;
}
```

And then I got stuck and spent a couple hours googling how to use a ```while loop```. I struggled because I'm pretty comfortable using ```for loops``` but ```while loops``` are tricky because they require a counter and I'm trying to get used to the fact that counting from 0 just means that it's at index 0 even if I'm looping through an array.

## Day 22: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deli Counter, Online Shopping

**Thoughts:**
