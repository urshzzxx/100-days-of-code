# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Goal:
1. Finish Web Developer Bootcamp
2. Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep
  - Ruby Fundamentals
  - JavaScript
3. Read JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett


## Day 1: July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked through ten JavaScript Basics Control Flow exercises on Web Developer Bootcamp. I relearned what while loops are and worked through some exercises. I also learned that I can very quickly break my computer with an infinite loop! :skull:

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling good! I struggled a few times with modulo % because I generally suck at math but I thought it was cool that you can write loops in different ways and have them output odd/even numbers. The indexOf() method was cool too. I like that Colt Steele brings up methods that we have to google during the exercises. It makes the work challenging, as if you're in an actual production environment. So I feel good! Makes my googling skills stronger!

## Day 2: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed the Intro to For Loops exercises on Web Developer Bootcamp. It was similar to the while loops exercises. I also finished JavaScript Functions tutorials and exercises, which covered functions syntax, arguments, return, scope and higher order functions.

**Thoughts:** Colt Steele's exercises are great. He teaches you how to google information if you don't know something so I've been trying master this skill; it'll be useful in the long run. I was frustrated with figuring out how to get a function to return a factorial of a number so I worked on it for a little bit, did some googling, and plugged in a few things and realized it worked! I needed the problem solution explanation though to understand why this is how the function returned a factorial. 

```
function factorial(num) {
  // define a result variable
  var result = 1;
  for(var i = 2; i <= num; i++){
    result *= i;
  }
  //return the result variable
  return result;
}
```
