# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: The goal was to learn git and GitHub. I watched a bunch of tutorials on YouTube from DevTips and other channels. I also skipped to the lessons about git and github in my online bootcamp lessons and learned that git and github are two seperate things. I don't know how to use command line yet because I'm a newbie but I think once I have a grasp on that, using terminal would be easier. I learned how to clone a repo though!

**Thoughts:** I got extremely stressed out and frustrated because I spent so much time watching tutorials on git and github and still felt like I didn't know how to use it. I wanted to log my progress and keep myself accountable for this challenge. I don't know how to commit and push changes onto github. But, I think once I play around with it a bit more I'll get it.
