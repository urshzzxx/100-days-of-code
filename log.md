# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished the HTML5 and CSS section of fCC. It was a refresher because I'm trying to catch up fCC with my Web Developer Bootcamp so that I can do JavaScript on both and gain two perspectives.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I'm already quite comfortable with HTML/CSS and googling things if I don't know something but it's always good to review everything. I'm not a big fan of freeCodeCamp's environment to code, but I thought the tutorials were helpful. They had a great explanation on hex colors, padding, and margins.

## Day 2: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Went over Bootstrap on freeCodeCamp and manually used some of the Bootstrap elements.

**Thoughts:** If I had to compare the tutorials on Bootstrap between the Web Developer Bootcamp vs freeCodeCamp, I think fCC has really good explanations using each element and nesting it into the HTML/CSS. I struggled with Bootstrap previously during the bootcamp and got very confused with columns and rows but fCC has a thorough explanation so I'm understanding how to use it.

## Day 3: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished all the exercises on freeCodeCamp covering Bootstrap. I'm going to start the jQuery exercises and try to knock those out too. jQuery seems fun to learn. 

**Thoughts:** I've decided that I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap. I like vanilla CSS. fCC does a good job explaining the classes and elements of Bootstrap but not really how to do research and modify them on our own. I didn't like Bootstrap when I was learning it in the Web Developer Bootcamp either because I feel like it just takes longer to use it than to use CSS/SASS. But I'm aware of how to use the framework if needed.
